# GrubDash-project

This project was completed by Jenni Grubbs as part of learning about backend development during the Thinkful Software Engineering program.

Its purpose is to set up the API using RESTful principles through an Express JS app.

It sets up a food delivery service's menu of dishes and the orders being placed. It allows for creating dishes, reading dishes, updating dishes and listing dishes, as well as creating orders, reading orders, updating orders, deleting orders (unless they have reached a certain stage) and listing orders.

This project does not and was not required to include a frontend, but there is an associated one that could be linked if desired.
